# Power Monitor Utils
This module contains helper functions to drive Monsoon Power Monitor using [PyMonsoon](https://github.com/msoon/PyMonsoon) library.

# Requirements
If you're using a first generation Power Monitor, i.e. white one, you'll probably have to upgrade its firmware before you can use the Python interface. 

The new and old firmwares have been committed here as well for ease of use and can be used using `upgrade_firmware()` and `downgrade_firmmware()` functions.
